        content: "After being captives of the pandemic for more than a year, we have begun experiencing the pleasures of simple outings: dining al fresco, shopping with a friend, taking a stroll through the zoo. As we snap a selfie by the sea lions for the first time in so long, it seems worth asking, after our collective ordeal, whether our pleasure in seeing wild animals up close is worth the price of their captivity."

        content: "The researchers examined more than 1200 studies on 35 species of carnivores. In the 2 October issue of Nature, they report that the larger the home range, the higher the frequency of pacing and the more infant deaths in captivity. Among the worst off were polar bears, which have a home range of 1000 square kilometers or more--about 1 million times bigger than their average enclosure, Mason says. They paced about 25% of the day and had an infant mortality rate of 65%. In contrast, brown bears, with a minimum range of 0.5 square kilometers, spent only 10% of the day pacing and had negligible infant mortality. Foraging time and general activity in the wild did not appear to affect pacing or infant mortality. Neither did time spent hunting, which Mason and Clubb had predicted would be the biggest problem for zoo carnivores."
